# Notes on the version
This is the old version - v.1.1.0. 
A parallel version is available on request (leiyangslu@gmail.com). It can process multiple samples one after another, but use multiple CPU cores for each sample. Gene capture data should be able to be efficiently processed by the parallel version.

# What can copyseparator do?
Separate and assemble two or more gene copies from short-read Next-Generation Sequencing data for polyploids, gene families, mixed/contaminated samples etc.

# How many gene copies can copyseparator separate?
Two or more. However, it works better when there is fewer (e.g. two) gene copies. That is because copyseparator uses clustering analyses to separate reads from different gene copies. The more the gene copies, the harder it is to separate them apart.

# What is the length of gene copies that copyseparator can separate?
Theoretically, if the coverage is high and relatively even, there is no limitation on the length. In reality, however, copyseparator is usually used to separate gene copies that are several hundred to several thousand base pairs long. I have used it to successfully separate mitogenomes (~16,000 bp) of two shark species, whose reads (from gene capture, paired-end, read length 300bp) have been combined intentionally. Long-read sequencing is the better way to go for separating very long gene copies.

# How to generate the input data for copyseparator?
1. PCR amplicons --- prepare libraries --- NGS short-read sequencing
2. Target gene capture --- NGS short-read sequencing
3. Some other ways ...

# Why short reads need to be mapped to a reference before runing copyseparator?
Mapping to a reference can organize the short reads in order. In this way, the subsets, the picked clusters and their respective consensus sequences, and the assembled gene copy sequences can all be in the correct order.

# Why the read-length has to be 250bp or longer?
During assembling, short reads can easily result in chimeric sequences. Email me at leiyangslu@gmail.com if you really want to use copyseparator for NGS data with a read length < 250bp.

# How to assemble gene copies if "sep_assem" or "copy_assemble" fails?
I use SeaView (http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview) to examine the results from "copy_separate". I prefer to assemble gene copies by moving sequences around and link gene copies by eye. It just like assembling the forward and reverse sequences from Sanger sequencing. Even if you prefer to use "copy_assemble", you still need to check the alignment first. Pay special attention to the nucleotide overhangs introduced by mistake during the calculation of consensus sequences of picked clusters.
